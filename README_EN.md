## Other Instructions

<ul>
<li>When the program prompts the user for input, pressing Enter directly will return to the previous menu, and inputting <code>Q</code> or <code>q</code> will end the program's execution.</li>
<li>Since fetching data for liked and favorites works of an account only returns the publication dates of those works, not the dates of the actions (liking or favouring), the program needs to retrieve all liked and favorites works data before performing date filtering. If there are a large number of works, this may take a considerable amount of time. The number of requests can be controlled via the <code>max_pages</code> parameter.</li>
<li>To obtain data for posts made by a private account, a logged-in Cookie is required, and the logged-in account must follow the private account.</li>
<li>When batch downloading account posts works or mix works, if the corresponding nickname or mark parameter changes, the program will automatically update the nickname and mark parameter in the file names of the downloaded works.</li>
<li>When downloading files, the program first downloads them to a temporary folder and then moves them to the storage folder upon completion. The temporary folder will be emptied when the program ends.</li>
<li>The <code>Batch Download Favorites Works Mode</code> currently only supports downloading favorited works for the account corresponding to the currently logged-in Cookie and does not support multiple accounts.</li>
<li>If you want the program to use a proxy to request data, you must set the <code>proxy</code> parameter in <code>settings.json</code>; otherwise, the program will not use a proxy.</li>
<li>To exit the program, please end it in a normal way or by pressing Ctrl + C. Do not directly close the terminal window, as this may result in data loss.</li>
<li>If your computer does not have a suitable program for editing JSON files, we recommend using the <a href="https://try8.cn/tool/format/json">JSON Online Tool</a> to edit the configuration file content.</li>
<li>When the program prompts the user to input content or links, please be careful to avoid including newline characters, as this may cause unexpected issues.</li>
<li>This project does not support downloading paid works. Please do not report any issues related to downloading paid works.</li>
<li>On Windows systems, the program needs to be run as an administrator to read Cookies from Chromium, Chrome, and Edge browsers.</li>
<li>This project has not been optimized for running multiple instances of the program. If you need to run multiple instances, please copy the entire project folder to avoid unexpected issues.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

## Program Update

> **Option 1:** Download and unzip the files, then copy the old version of the `TikTokDownloader.db` file and the
`settings.json` file into the `_internal` folder.

> **Option 2:** Download and unzip the files \(without running the program), then copy all the files and directly
> overwrite the old version files.
